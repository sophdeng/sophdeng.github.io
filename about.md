Hi, I'm Sophia. 
<br> <br>
I work in product at <a href="https://remote.com/">Remote</a>, and previously was at <a href="http://instacart.com/">Instacart</a>, <a href="https://gigster.com/">Gigster</a> and <a href="https://ramp.com/">Ramp</a> in product and operational roles.  

Being fairly or very early at four hyper-growth startups has been ridiculously masochistic. At the same time, there's no other better way to learn how to build companies and things people want. I hope some of my thinking will be interesting to you.
