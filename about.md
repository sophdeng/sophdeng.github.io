Hi, I'm Sophia. 
<br> <br>
I am building something new in consumer genAI.  I previously was at <a href="https://remote.com/">Remote</a>, <a href="http://instacart.com/">Instacart</a>, <a href="https://gigster.com/">Gigster</a> and <a href="https://ramp.com/">Ramp</a> doing product, operations and anything in-between.  

Being early or very early at four hyper-growth startups has been masochistic, but there's no other better way to learn how to build companies and things people want.  And now, I get to experience the ridiculous masochism of starting something. I hope some of my thinking will be interesting to you.

ðŸ‘¾ If you like games, craft and philosophy, I self-produce (so be nice!) a games podcast, Game of Life Podcast. You can listen on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0hSDeYssbPB7SEY7ZWarxs?si=v2GxpCNZTA61V8_UgssinA">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/game-of-life-podcast/id1666618871">Apple Podcasts</a> or <a href="https://anchor.fm/gameoflifepod">wherever you listen to podcasts</a>.
